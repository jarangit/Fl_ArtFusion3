          247flashloans.com (the "website") is not an offer or solicitation to
          lend. The website only provides a service and is not an agent,
          representative, or broker of any lender and does not endorse or charge
          you for any loan or product. The website operators are not lenders, do
          not make loans of any type, and do not make credit decisions. The
          website collects personal information provided by you and forwards it
          to partners in our lender network. You are under no obligation to use
          this website or service to initiate, contact, nor apply for credit or
          any loan product with any service provider or lender. Loan amounts
          vary from $500 and $35,000 but not all lenders can provide up to
          $35,000. Providing your information on the website does not guarantee
          you will be approved for a loan or credit product. Cash transfer times
          may vary between lenders and may depend on your individual financial
          institution. In some circumstances faxing may be required. If you have
          any questions, contact your lender directly for details, questions, or
          concerns regarding your loan or credit product. Short-term cash loans
          are meant to provide you with short-term financing to solve immediate
          cash needs and should not be considered a long-term solution. This
          service and lenders are not available in all states. Lenders may
          perform credit checks with the three credit reporting bureaus:
          Experian, Equifax, or Trans Union or may perform alternative credit
          checks or consumer reports through alternative providers. By
          submitting your request, you acknowledge, agree, and authorize that
          (a) your information may be sent to lenders and/or third-party
          partners on your behalf, and (b) such lenders may obtain consumer
          reports and related information about you from one or more consumer
          reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, Experian and Equifax to
          evaluate your creditworthiness.
